The annotator implemented here detects differences from one frame to the next.
It also collects summaries of the overall brightness and saturation of a frame.
These are all useful for detecting shot boundaries and scene breaks.

class DiffAnnotator(FrameAnnotator):
    """Annotator for detecting differences between frames.

    The annotator will return data for each frame in a given batch by showing
    how much a frame differs compares to the next one. It computes two kinds of
    differences. The first down samples the image to a small square and takes
    pixel-by-pixel differences between the frames. The second computes a
    histogram in HSV space and compares the histogram counts between frames.
    Results for both are given by taking quantiles of the differences. The
    histogram differences are normalized to account for comparisons across
    different image sizes.

    Additionally, the average value (darkness) of each frame is provided to
    assist with putting the differences in context.

    Attributes:
        quantiles (list): A list of integers or floats giving the quantiles to
            return. Set to None to only return the average value of each frame.
            Inputs are given as percentiles, so [50] will return the median.
        size (int): Side length of the square that the image will be
            downsampled to for the pixel-by-pixel comparison.
        bins (int): How many bins to include in the histogram differences. Will
            make this many bins for each of hue, saturation, and value.
        name (str): A description of the aggregator. Used as a key in the
            output data.
